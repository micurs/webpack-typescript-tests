# React in ES6

In this example we use Bebel to compile ES6 code and
build React components.
We bundle the whole thing with WebPack into `dist/bundle.js`.

First, get the local dependencies:

    npm install

Run Webpack to build the bundle

    webpack --progress

Finally run the http-server

    http-server -p 3000

See the result on `http://localhost:3000`
